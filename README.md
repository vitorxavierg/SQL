# SQL
Structured Query Language is a super important language used to deal with databases.
I've made some projects using SQL, and want to share a little about them:

**(1) - Data Cleaning with SQL Server - Walkthrough**  
https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/data-cleaning-with-sql-server-walkthrough-e4521447e7ae

In this project I've made some basics processes using SQL: 
1. Exploring the Dataset; 
2. Standardizing Date Format; 
3. Removing Missing Data; 
4. Breaking out one column into distinct columns; 
5. Fixing String Typos; 
6. Removing Duplicated Rows.

**(2) - Carros Seminovos — Estudo com SQL e Visualização com Tableau Public**

In this project, I've made an exploratory data analysis using a dataset of used car sales.
With the exploration, the following questions were answered:

1. What are the top selling brands?
2. Are there regions that sell more than others?
3. What are the brands that represents the majority revenues?
4. What are the States and Cities that generate the majority revenues?
5. What is the average ticket per State?
