# SQL
Structured Query Language is a super important language used to manage databases.
I've made some projects using SQL, and want to share a little about them:

**(I) - Data Cleaning with SQL Server - Walkthrough**  
https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/data-cleaning-with-sql-server-walkthrough-e4521447e7ae

In this project I've made some basics processes using SQL: 
1. Exploring the Dataset; 
2. Standardizing Date Format; 
3. Removing Missing Data; 
4. Breaking out one column into distinct columns; 
5. Fixing String Typos; 
6. Removing Duplicated Rows.
